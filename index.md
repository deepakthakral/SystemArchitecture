The Purpose of this documentation is to implement Documentation as Code (DaC) practices, across the engineering value chain initially for Connect Technology and ultimately for all of WSIT. 

This will ensure that all documentations are consistent, efficient, and adds value at each stage of the development process, thereby improving communication, knowledge transfer, and overall process efficiency.
